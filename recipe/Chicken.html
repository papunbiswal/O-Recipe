    </p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u> :-</h3>
    <p>
        1 kg Chicken skinless, bone-in, curry cut (cut into 1.5 inch pieces)<br>
        ▢½ teaspoon Turmeric Powder<br>
        ▢½ cup Curd/Yogurt<br>
        ▢3 Onions roughly diced<br>
        ▢8-10 Garlic Cloves peeled<br>
        ▢1 inch Ginger<br>
        ▢4 Tomatoes roughly diced<br>
        ▢3 tablespoon Oil<br>
        ▢1 teaspoon Jeera<br>
        ▢1 Bay Leaf<br>
        ▢2 Cardamom Pods<br>
        ▢2 tablespoon Meat Masala<br>
        ▢1 tablespoon Coriander Powder<br>
        ▢½ teaspoon Turmeric Powder<br>
        ▢2 teaspoon Kashmiri Chilli Powder<br>
        ▢1.5 teaspoon Salt divided<br>
        ▢1-1.5 cups Water<br>
        ▢2-3 Green Chillies<br>
        ▢¼ cup Coriander finely chopped<br>

    </p>
    <h3><u>Steps</u> :-</h3>
    <p>
        1. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in heavy bottom pan. When the oil turns hot, add :<br>
            • 1 small bay leaf (or 1 sprig curry leaves)<br>
            • 2 inch cinnamon piece<br>
            • 4 cloves<br>
            • 3 green cardamoms. (All of these are optional but recommended)<br>
        2. Add 1 cup very finely chopped onions and 1 chopped green chili pepper. Saute the onions till they turn golden. To speed up, I used another tbsp of oil here and this is optional.<br>
        3. Add 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste. Make sure the onions turn golden before adding ginger garlic.<br>
        4. Saute ginger garlic for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the raw smell disappears completely.<br>
        5. Add ½ cup tomatoes (chopped or mashed or pureed). Also add ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt.<br>
        6. Next fry until the tomatoes turn completely mushy and the raw smell has gone.<br>
        7. Add 1 teaspoon red chili powder and 1/4 cup whisked yogurt (curd). Check the tips section below to know tips on how to prevent yogurt from splitting in the curry. To substitute yogurt, you can soak 12 cashew nuts or almonds or 3 tablespoons white poppy seeds in 1½ cup hot water for 30 minutes. Blend it to a smooth paste & add here.<br>
        8. Saute on a medium flame until the mixture becomes thick and begins to smell good. Optional If you do not like chunky onions in your curry, then cool and blend this with water to a smooth puree.<br>
        9. Add the following ingredients :<br>
            • 1/2 kg chicken (about 1 lb)<br>
            • 1 teaspoon garam masala powder<br>
            • 1 teaspoon coriander powder<br>
            • 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves.<br>
        10. Saute for 3 to 4 mins or until the chicken turns pale.<br>
        11. Cover and cook on a low flame for about 3 to 4 mins so the chicken absorbs the flavors. Meanwhile, heat 1 cup water in a separate pot. You can also microwave the water in a cup for 1 min.<br>
        12. Pour ½ to ½ cup hot water or as needed. Using cold water often makes the meat tough & hard.<br>
        13. Make sure you use just enough water to partially cover the chicken. Cover and cook on a low to medium heat until soft tender. It took about 10 mins for me. This may vary depending on the age of the chicken or the size of the pieces. Do not cook on a high temperature.<br>
        14. Lastly check whether the chicken is done by pricking it with a fork. It must be soft and should fall off the bone easily. Taste the curry and add more salt if need. Also add ½ teaspoon more garam masala.<br>
