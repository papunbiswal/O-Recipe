       2. salt<br>
       3. turmeric powder<br>
       4. mustard oil<br>
       5. ginger paste<br>

    </p>
    <h3><u>Steps</u> :-</h3>
    <p>
       1. On a low to medium flame, gently heat oil in a pan or pressure cooker. Add the spices cinnamon, cardamoms and bay leaf (optional), followed by onions & green chilies.<br>
       2. Saute until onions turn golden. Lower the flame to very low as much as possible. Then transfer the marinated mutton and saute for 5 to 7 mins.<br>
       3. Stir in the meat masala & curry leaves (optional), followed by pureed tomatoes.<br>
       4. Increase the heat to medium and saute for another 5 to 7 mins, until the raw flavor of tomatoes has reduced. Pour hot water & mix well.<br>
       5. To cook in a regular pot: Bring it to a gentle boil and cook covered on a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir well every 12 to 15 minutes and pour more hot water in batches as needed.<br>
       6. Stovetop Pressure Cooker: Pressure cook on a medium heat for 4 to 5 whistles, depending on the kind or cooker, meat and size of the mutton pieces.<br>
       7. When the pressure drops, open the lid and mix well. If the curry is runny, cook/saute for a few more minutes.<br>
       8. Your mutton is cooked through when it is tender, flakes easily with a fork and falls off the bone easily.<br>
       9. Taste the curry and add more salt if needed. If you feel it is low on flavor, you may sprinkle little garam masala. Garnish with fine chopped coriander.<br>
