    <h3><u>Description</u> :-</h3>
    <p><ul><li>This restaurant style Paneer curry gets its unique flavor from freshly ground spices like coriander and red chilies! Enjoy it with naan or paratha.</li></ul></p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u> :-</h3>
    <p>
        1. Paneer 200 grams.<br>
        2. 1 cup fine chopped onions.<br>
        3. 1½ cup ripe tomatoes.<br>
        4. 1 teaspoon grated ginger or crushed.<br>
        5. 1 teaspoon grated garlic or crushed.<br>
        6. 1 Indian bay leaf.<br>
        7. 2 dried red chilies.<br>
        8. 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds.<br>
        9. 1 to 1½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder.<br>
        10. 1 teaspoon coriander.<br>
        11. 1½ cumin powder.<br>
        12. 3/4 to 1 teaspoon garam masala.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><u>Steps</u> :-</h3>
    <p>
        1. First, soak 12 to 15 cashews in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.<br>
        2. When the cashews are soaking, roughly chop 2 large tomatoes, 1 large onion, 1 inch ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium garlic cloves. Crush the ginger and garlic to a paste in mortar-pestle.<br>
        3. Add the chopped onions to a blender or grinder jar.<br>
        4. Without adding any water, grind or blend to a smooth and fine paste. Remove to a bowl and set aside.<br>
        5. To the same grinder jar (no need to wash it), add chopped tomatoes and soaked cashews.<br>
        6. Again without adding any water, grind or blend tomatoes and cashews to a fine smooth paste. Keep the jar aside.<br>
        7. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a thick bottomed pan or kadai. Add the onion paste.<br>
        8. Sauté the onion paste over a low to medium-low heat, stirring often. Be careful while adding onion paste as it splutters.<br>
        9. Sauté till the onion paste begins to caramelize and become golden.<br>
        10. Add the crushed ginger-garlic paste. If using ready ginger-garlic paste, then add 1 teaspoon of it.<br>
        11. Stir and sauté for few seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.<br>
        12. Now add the tomato-cashew paste. Be careful as the mixture can splutter.<br>
        13. Mix everything very well and begin to sauté the masala on a low heat.<br>
        14. While the masala is cooking, add 1.5 cups of water to the grinder or blender jar. Swirl the jar so that the tomato paste at the sides and at the bottom gets mixed with the water.<br>
        15. Continue sautéing and stirring the onion-tomato-cashew masala till you see some fat releasing from the sides and the sauce becomes glossy.<br>
        16. Then add the following ground spices:
        <un><li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon red chilli powder or cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon coriander powder.</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.</li></un>
        17. Stir and mix in the spice powders very well.<br>
        18. Add 1 or 2 slit green chilies.<br>
        19. Add the water which you mixed with the leftover tomato+cashew paste from the grinder or blender jar.<br>
        20. Season with salt as required.<br>
        21. Add 1 tablespoon of chopped coriander leaves.<br>
        22. On a low to medium heat, simmer the gravy till it thickens a bit and you see oil specks on top.<br>
        23. Then add 200 grams paneer that has been cut into cubes or squares. Preferably use homemade soft paneer.<br>
        24. Add ½ teaspoon of crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves). Mix well and switch off the heat.<br>
